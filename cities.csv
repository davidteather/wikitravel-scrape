City,Source Link,Paragraph Content
Luanda,https://wikitravel.org/en/Luanda,The majority of restaurants are on The Marginal or on Ilha de Luanda%2C but you can find other very good restaurants all along town. Be careful; when eating out%2C do not drink tap water%2C ask for mineral water instead.
Brisbane,https://wikitravel.org/en/Brisbane,Recent strong migration to Brisbane and the whole of south-east Queensland is taking place due to cheaper house prices%2C a pleasant climate%2C and good employment opportunities. The area is currently facing the challenge of providing enough fresh water for its residents. You're not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage%2C but keep your showers relatively brief (local water restrictions call for 4 minute showers).
Graz,https://wikitravel.org/en/Graz,Graz has a lot of cafés all around the town%2C very concentrated in the city center and university district and you get tasty coffee almost everywhere. Prices are the same in most cafes%2C they just get slightly more expensive in Herrengasse or on Schlossberg. The most common coffee beverages are a "Verlängerter" (a small Americano with milk; 2%2C20-2%2C40€)%2C a "Cappuccino" (2%2C40-2%2C60€)%2C a Café Latte (coffee with lots of steamed milk; 2%2C60-2%2C90€). It is common that you get a glass of tap water to your coffee%2C if not don't hesitate to ask for it.
Tuzla,https://wikitravel.org/en/Tuzla,There is%2C also%2C City Fountain%2C built in 1888. located in very center of old town on Trg Slobode. You can tap fresh water here (for free). Better than buying plastic bottles!
Tuzla,https://wikitravel.org/en/Tuzla,Tap water is perfectly fine for drinking%2C and food quality tends to be good%2C as food safety regulations comply with those of the European union.
Belo Horizonte,https://wikitravel.org/en/Belo_Horizonte,Tap water provided by COPASA (sole provider for the city) is regarded as fully potable (filtered%2C sterilized%2C PH controlled and fluoridated)%2C but it is important to note that due to historical unreliability of water supply in Brazil%2C the vast majority of buildings have water tanks%2C so even if it is provided by COPASA%2C if you are unsure of the sanitary conditions of the building water tank%2C you should avoid drinking it before filtering%2C boiling or ozonizing it.
Belo Horizonte,https://wikitravel.org/en/Belo_Horizonte,Even though bottled water in Brazil is labeled as “mineral water”%2C you should be careful and use good sense when buying it. Cases of tap water and untreated water being bottled and labeled as “mineral” are not uncommon. Always check the color of the water%2C the general aspect of the bottle and the seal. Some Brazilians are used to untreated water but it is very likely that tourists will have serious issues with it%2C including diarrhea%2C vomits%2C fever%2C headaches and muscular pain. It is usually safer to drink COPASA tap water then bootleg bottled water.Free healthcare is widely available%2C but waiting times may be long (even on minor emergencies)%2C for non urgent cases go to the free “Posto de Saúde” near where you are staying (there are plenty all over the city). Private hospitals usually have faster service and better facilities and you can pay your treatment with either cash or with your insurance. Check with your insurance company the hospitals and clinics covered beforehand. If you have any allergies or known health problems%2C it is wise to learn some Portuguese words to describe it as it is very likely most of the hospital staff won’t speak English except for more qualified MDs%2C nurses and social workers. Although you might not see any initial difference%2C nurses are divided into “college nurses”%2C “technical nurses” and “auxiliary nurses”. You are more likely to find an English speaker amongst the college nurses (they are called Enfermeira or Enfermeiro and usually act as sector supervisors in a hospital).
Belém,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bel%C3%A9m,While in Belém you should not drink tap water%2C though you can use water from the tap to wash vegetables%2C brush your teeth%2C etc. As Belém is located approximately 100 mi south of the equator%2C the sun is particularly strong year-round%2C so fair-skinned travelers should apply sunscreen on a daily basis. Additionally%2C be sure to apply mosquito repellent when going out after sunset. Malaria is not a major concern in Belém%2C but if you are traveling to remote areas of Pará during the rainy season you should%2C after consulting with your doctor%2C consider taking malaria pills. The CDC recommends getting a Yellow Fever vaccine for travel in Pará and many other parts of Brazil. You can learn more about recommended vaccinations for Brazil on the CDC website [5].
Fortaleza,https://wikitravel.org/en/Fortaleza,As a rule of thumb%2C try to avoid drinking tap water. If you travel west from Fortaleza%2C into the states of Maranhão%2C Pará or further%2C Brazilian authorities recommend that you get a yellow fever vaccination. An International Certificate of Vaccination [58] can be issued if you have the shot taken at the airport or in the city center. If you already have your booklet%2C and only need a new shot and the corresponding entry%2C this is best done at the medical center at Avenida Antonio Justa%2C one block from Pão de Açucar%2C weekdays 7 AM to 4:30 PM%2C free of charge.
Montes Claros,https://wikitravel.org/en/Montes_Claros,The city has a complete sewering system and tap water is clean but should not be consumed since it is hard water (high concentration of calcarium) It can be drink if filtered by any most of filtering methods. Buying bottled water is very cheap though and most people do it.
Salvador,https://wikitravel.org/en/Salvador,Visiting a Salvador beach is a highlight for many tourists. One of the main central Salvador beaches is Porto de Barra. It was originally the site of the first settlement of european newcomers to Bahia. It can get very crowded on weekends. The northeast region of Salvador concentrates most beaches with good water quality. Flamengo and Stella Maris are the most popular beaches among tourists and upper class locals. They have excellent tourist infrastructure and rough waters excellent for surfing. Jaguaribe%2C Piatã and Itapoã%2C with calmer waters%2C are mostly frequented by locals and can become quite crowded at weekends. They are a good option with you want to mix with the local population%2C but don't bring anything besides your clothes%2C sunglasses%2C sunscreen%2C and some cash%2C as muggings are quite common.
Chongqing,https://wikitravel.org/en/Chongqing,Further down the road%2C the focus changes towards kitchen and bath%2C with stoves%2C freezers and refrigerators%2C kitchen fans%2C table and floor cooling fans%2C electric water heaters%2C taps and showers%2C lamps (also inwall LEDs)%2C power switches%2C electrical and ethernet sockets%2C AC units and bug zappers%2C and even further down%2C power tools.
Dalian,https://wikitravel.org/en/Dalian,Health-wise Dalian's relatively low levels of pollution (when compared to other domestic cities) mean health problems from the bad air are less of an issue than in other Chinese cities. The water%2C while technically drinkable%2C is made drinkable via the addition of hefty amounts of chemicals and pipes are seldom kept in the best condition so boiling is pretty much mandatory%2C and bottled water is usually a safer bet  -- locals either boil tap water or buy filtered water. Tap water should be fine for brushing teeth and washing with%2C however. The complete lack of any health inspection mechanism means food poisoning is a constant danger%2C but most restaurants should be OK. Even still%2C however%2C nice restaurants are known to sell outdated seafood from time to time. Avoid any restaurants that seem strangely quiet (customers tend not to return to places that leave them on the toilet for a week). It's always a good idea to pack a few diarrhoea tablets before leaving%2C just in case. Hospitals are liberally scattered throughout the city with the Friendship Hospital on Wuwu Lu (+86 411 8271-8822) and the first affiliated hospital of Dalian Medical University (Also known as "Fuyi" in Chinese) are the most likely to have English speaking staff. China's hyper-capitalist health-care system means that payment in cash is required before any treatment is dished out%2C so make sure to bring a few hundred yuan with you should you need medical attention.
Kaohsiung,https://wikitravel.org/en/Kaohsiung,Locals consider the tap water NOT to be potable%2C though as in most of Taiwan%2C the government claims water quality is now up to international standards. Filtered water dispensing stations are present throughout the city%2C though some have been accused of simply distributing tap water. Restaurant water is safe%2C with the possible exception of some lunchbox eateries and stands on the street.
Sanya,https://wikitravel.org/en/Sanya,The tap water%2C even in nice hotels%2C should not be considered safe to drink as the tap water in Sanya is generally not potable. Bring or buy bottled water if you plan to be outside of your accommodations for long periods of time. If you have access to a kettle in your hotel room or rented apartment%2C boiled water is fine to drink.
Shanghai,https://wikitravel.org/en/Shanghai,Do not drink Shanghai's tap water unless it is boiled or goes through purification process. Even when you are staying at a five-star hotel. Drinking the water is relatively safe when it has been boiled; however%2C tap water is also said to contain high amounts of heavy metals which are not removed by boiling.  When buying bottled water%2C you will come across a whole range of mineral water brands. Cheaper brands cost ¥1-2.50 and are in all the convenience stores and street stands. If you're worried about the bottled water%2C check if the seal has been tampered with. For the very worried%2C imported bottled water is available in the basement supermarkets of Isetan%2C Jiuguang%2C and Takashimaya department stores (expect to pay ¥15-30 per 2L)%2C as well as some other supermarkets specializing in imports. As of spring 2013%2C NONGFU Springs water has been found not to meet national standards and is best avoided until we see otherwise.
Shenzhen,https://wikitravel.org/en/Shenzhen,Tap Water is  safe to drink in the Meilin district and several nearby districts%2C but probably not in the area where you are staying. Use the free bottled water or distilled water provided by your hotel or buy some. It's easily available in all convenience stores. However%2C if you are buying water for 5 RMB a bottle%2C you are getting majorly ripped off.
Suzhou,https://wikitravel.org/en/Suzhou,Like in most of China%2C tap water is not safe for drinking%2C but fine for washing and cleaning teeth%2C and safe if boiled.
Suzhou,https://wikitravel.org/en/Suzhou,Like in most of China%2C tap water is not safe for drinking%2C but fine for washing and cleaning teeth%2C and safe if boiled.
Hong Kong,https://wikitravel.org/en/Hong_Kong,Tap water in Hong Kong has been proven to be drinkable%2C although most of the local people still prefer to boil and chill their drinking water when it is taken from the tap. The official advice from the Water Board is that the water is perfectly safe to drink unless you are living in an old building with outdated plumbing and poorly maintained water tanks. Bottled water is strongly recommended by locals but remember that Hong Kong's landfill sites are filling up fast and plastic bottles are a major environmental problem%2C so use recycling bins where provided.
Macau,https://wikitravel.org/en/Macau,Whilst tap water is technically safe to drink (taste aside)%2C most locals boil or filter their water or buy inexpensive bottled water%2C which you are also recommended to do so. A 2.5 litre bottle of drinking water starts around $0.25 in supermarkets.
Armenia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Armenia,The tap water is generally safe as it comes directly from mountains%2C but you may also purchase bottled water. You can get both mineral water and spring water on almost every street corner in both rural areas and the capital.
Manizales,https://wikitravel.org/en/Manizales,The water quality here is excellent (Manizales' water is on the top 10 of best quality drinking waters in the world)%2C it is very pure also it is possible to drink straight from the tap here (but not in all parts of Colombia is this true)%2C so no need to purchase bottled water and taste is great!
Pereira,https://wikitravel.org/en/Pereira,The water quality here is excellent (Pereira water is on the top 20 of best quality drinking waters in the world). It is very pure also it is possible to drink straight from the tap here (but not in all parts of Colombia is this true)%2C so no need to purchase bottled water and taste is great!
Lemesos,https://wikitravel.org/en/Limassol,Drinking water: It is generally safe to drink water directly from the tap. Most apartments/hotels would have a separate tap provided along with the sink%2C for water that bypasses the storage tank on the roof.
Kinshasa,https://wikitravel.org/en/Kinshasa,Do not drink from the tap. Bottled water is readily available.  Also%2C when cleaning your teeth make sure that you use bottled water.
Copenhagen,https://wikitravel.org/en/Copenhagen,Going on a canal tour of the inner harbour and canals is an excellent and easy way to see many of the city's attractions%2C and fortunately there are many options depending on your taste and preferences. DFDS Canal Tours operates both a unguided hop-on hop-off service%2C branded as the water bus%2C arranged into three circular trips at the northern%2C central and southern part of the inner harbour and canals. They also have three guided tours%2C either by a pre-recorded tape available in many languages%2C or live English & Danish commentary by a guide. Be forewarned though%2C after 75 minutes this can get a bit loud if you are not normally attracted to this sort of tourism. Netto-bådene offers a single fixed tour%2C but at a much lower price. Please note that services are scaled back considerably between October and mid-March. If you are visiting during winter%2C you might want to opt for DFDS' red guided tour%2C as it offers a heated%2C glass-roofed boat at this time of the year. Both companies offer starting points in either Nyhavn or Gammel Strand (opposite the parliament). A different option is the public harbour bus%2C which%2C while it doesn't enter the canals%2C is much faster and is an integrated part of the public transportation system using the same tickets as buses and trains.
Cairo,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cairo,For health reasons it is advisable not to drink tap water or eat unpeeled fresh fruits and vegetables -- at least for the first few days of the visit. There are few solely vegetarian options%2C L'aubergine in Zamalek is a good restaurant for vegetarian food. Otherwise%2C Egyptian cuisine is dominated by vegetable courses%2C but be aware of "hidden" meat in stock%2C sauces and the like. One should also be cautious about sushis( slushees?) or ice creams sold outside of main hotels. Also%2C if served eggs%2C one should be cautious to ensure that they are fully cooked (sunny side up eggs may allow certain organisms to be transmitted).
Cairo,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cairo,A health reminder Use extra care if you choose to consume beverages from fruit stalls. In general%2C food handling procedures are not up to Western food sanitation standards. It should also be noted that some vendors mix their fruit juices with less-than-perfect tap-water.
Cairo,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cairo,As elsewhere in Egypt%2C be careful with what you eat. Raw leafy vegetables%2C egg-based dressings like mayonnaise and minced meat are particularly risky. Avoid cold salads and puddings from buffets even in the 5* hotels just to be on the safe side.Opinions on tap water vary%2C but most visitors choose to stick to the bottled stuff. Large bottles of water can be purchased for 6-7 LE. Avoid ice in drinks%2C and only eat fruit with a skin you can wash or peel.You may find that tummy medications you bring from home simply don't work.All visitors would do well to buy from any pharmacy Egyptian brand drugs. The best and most common being Entocid and Antinal. Diarrhea and vomiting can almost always be stopped by taking 2 of these tablets with a glass of water in a few hours.If symptoms persist%2C it is wise to consult a doctor as dehydration in Summer can come on quickly.
Asmara,https://wikitravel.org/en/Asmara,Drink a lot because Asmara will dry you out. Mineral water is there in abundance and that is really the only water you can drink. Don't drink the tapwater if you value your health. Similarly%2C there are also a lot of bottled fruit juices%2C 'Fresh' juices are typically safe to drink in the cleaner bars and restaurants.
Tampere,https://wikitravel.org/en/Tampere,Quality-wise there are no really avoidable restaurants in the city either; some kebab joints can be a little bit disappointing%2C but at least the Finnish hygiene laws make sure that there's nothing wrong with the food per se. Tap water is safe to drink anywhere in Tampere (and in Finland).
Lyon,https://wikitravel.org/en/Lyon,Restaurants have their menus with prices displayed outside. As everywhere in France%2C the prices always include service%2C bread and tap water (ask for a carafe of water). Tipping is rare and only expected if you are particularly satisfied with the service. This is especially true in budget or mid-range restaurants%2C maybe less so in expensive places where it may be considered more appropriate; nothing is compulsory%2C though. Typical tips depend%2C of course%2C on the price of the menu and your level of satisfaction but they are generally not as high as in the US%2C for example. If you pay by credit card and wish to add a tip%2C you can tell the person in charge how much he/she should charge your card.
Nice,https://wikitravel.org/en/Nice,With the hot Niçois summers%2C carrying a bottle of water is almost a must. Bear in mind the largest single complaint to the municipal authority tourist department is the offering in restaurants of branded water bottles whose seal has been broken - ie refilled with tap water - and charged as Perrier or Evian.
Paris,https://wikitravel.org/en/Paris,Eating out in Paris can be expensive. However don't believe people when they say you can't do Paris on the cheap - you can! The key is to stay away from the beaten tracks and the obviously expensive Champs Elysées. Around the lesser visited quarters especially%2C there are many cheap and yummy restaurants to be found. The key is to order from the prix-fixe menu%2C and not off the A la Carte menu unless you want to pay an arm and a leg. In many places a three course meal can be found for about €15. This way you can sample the food cheaply and is usually more "French". Ask for "une carafe d'eau" (oon karaaf doe) to get free tap water.
Libreville,https://wikitravel.org/en/Libreville,Eating at any good restaurant ends up costing about $24+ for the meal and drinks. Not cheap but it is usually worth it! There are some high end restaurants that can be compared to the best restaurants in Western metropoles. The standard of quality in cheaper restaurants is high. Try one of the three Papa Union restaurants. A great place to have a meal is the restaurant/hotel Excellence in the quartier Ancien Sobraga. It is run by a Belgian guy%2C and they serve Python a la sauce tomate. Delicious. The main road leading up into the Louis area (from the seafront near Jeanne Eboli Hospital) has a good range of restaurants and clubs. Costa Sylvia Pizzeria makes a very nice Neptune pizza. The Chinese restaurant opposite Le Warhol's is nice too.The good thing about Libreville is that one can eat salads in the restaurants%2C and there is no need to be afraid of the ice cubes in your drink. The tap water is absolutely ok.  L'Emir has very good Lebanese food and the owners are friendly.
Thessaloniki,https://wikitravel.org/en/Thessaloniki,Tap water is safe and that's what people of the city drink%2C but in some places in the city center you might get a slight "taste" from the water%2C due to old pipelines in the buildings. For peace of mind%2C you might want to buy bottled water. Greece is also a sunny place and if your skin is light-colored%2C intense sunlight can be a serious danger. Use sunscreen%2C a hat and sunglasses.
Quetzaltenango,https://wikitravel.org/en/Quetzaltenango,Don't drink the tap water. Some hostels will have a water filter%2C which many drink from%2C and it seems to be safe. Otherwise%2C drink purified water (agua pura).
Budapest,https://wikitravel.org/en/Budapest,Budapest is famous for its thermal baths%2C where tourists and locals go to swim%2C relax%2C and soak in hot or cold mineral waters. Thermal baths differ from normal baths or swimming pools because their hot water is drawn up from deep under the earth's surface where temperatures are higher. The thermal hot water saves on heating bills and also has different mineral contents compared to normal tap water. Soaking in certain types of mineral water is considered to have health benefits for some types of health problems%2C so it's not uncommon for Hungarians or visitors to come to the baths for therapeutic reasons%2C sometimes even prescribed by a doctor. Thermal bathing is more popular in Hungary than in other destinations for several reasons. First%2C because of Budapest's geography%2C thermal waters run closer to the surface here than in other places. Secondly%2C thermal bathing was (and is) popular among many Turkish cultures%2C and Hungary was occupied by the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire for many years. In Budapest%2C some thermal baths are large%2C historic complexes visited as a cultural as well as a bathing experience. Other thermal baths are operated more as spa hotels%2C with thermal water but in a modern%2C spa-like atmosphere.
Budapest,https://wikitravel.org/en/Budapest,Tap water throughout Budapest is safe to drink%2C so carry a bottle you can refill. Public fountains are often available throughout the city. Some look like regular drinking fountains. Others are decorative fountains (e.g. statue of a lion with water coming from it's mouth) but are also safe to drink from. It can be hard to tell which fountains are for drinking%2C but it's likely okay if there's either a steady stream of flowing water (versus water bubbling up from a spout)%2C a button that makes the water flow%2C and/or if you can walk right up to the stream of water (versus if there's a guard rail or fence). If in doubt%2C ask someone.
Belgaum,https://wikitravel.org/en/Belgaum,Gokak Falls: Gokak Falls is a waterfall known for its beauty. It is at a distance of 60 Kms from Belgaum and 10kms from Gokak town. Located right on the main road is a celebrated tourist centre in the district. This falls has a height of about 170 feet. The river Ghataprapha after winding a course of a long route takes a leap of 52 meters%2C over a rocky bed 170 feet down. The falls is famous for its spread and shape. The rugged valley and the picturesque is what inspires poetry. The dull roar of the falls can be heard much before you reach it. "Except in width and colour of the water%2C the general features of the fall%2C its height%2C shape and rapidity above are much like those of Niagara". The falls are horse-shoe shaped at the crest%2C with a flood breadth of 177 metres. June to September is the best season to visit Gokak as it bees in full bloom. Electricity was generated here for the first time in the country in 1887. This generating station can be reached on the rope way.
Chennai,https://wikitravel.org/en/Chennai,While in Chennai it is advisable to drink only bottled water. Do not trust water from small local restaurants as it may be from the tap%2C and avoid cold or iced drinks that are not commercially sold (Bigger chains of eateries and juice shops can be trusted to an extent). Eating fresh vegetables and fruits that have sat outside in the presence of insects can also be unhealthy%2C although bananas and coconuts are usually safe because they are opened only immediately before eating. Hot drinks in restaurants such as tea%2C coffee%2C and other local specialties are safe%2C as are packaged/bottled drinks such as Aquafina water%2C Frooti (a popular local mango drink) and others. If you have access to a stove%2C boiling tap water before drinking is also an option. Never eat from roadside shops as the food is prepared in the most unhygienic conditions.
Machilipatnam,https://wikitravel.org/en/Machilipatnam,If you have the habit of drinking mineral water%2C better to continue the same habit.

Mineral water is available every where and costs around Rs 15/- per litre bottle. All popular brands in India are available in shops.
Munger,https://wikitravel.org/en/Munger,A village in the Kharagpur subdivision%2C within the Kharagpur police-station with an area of 4137 acres. It is situated about 12 miles south-west of Kharagpur and four miles north of Guddih. Close to the village are some hot springs%2C called Tatal-pani (Tapta-pani) with are by far the finest in the district.

Batam,https://wikitravel.org/en/Batam,City authorities claim that Batam's tap water is potable%2C but the rusty color puts some people off.  Most people choose to stick with bottled water anyway%2C about Rp. 10%2C000 for a 5-gallon jug.
Jakarta,https://wikitravel.org/en/Jakarta,There are three sources of tap water in Jakarta: 1) from drinking-water company%2C 2) from deep artesian wells%2C and 3) from shallow wells. Water from source #1 and #2%2C originally are drinkable when it leaves the source%2C but some pipes maybe ill-maintained.

Bari,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bari,The ancient part of the city%2C called Bari Vecchia by locals%2C literally Old Bari%2C is a beautiful mediaeval neighborhood you should not miss. Take a stroll and get lost in the maze of Bari Vecchia and try not to miss the  romanic Basilica of Saint Nicholas with its gold ceiling%2C its crypt and the magnificent cathedra of Bishop Elias. In the same square%2C also the Palazzo del Catapano and the Church of Saint Gregory are worth a visit. Even older (but later refurbished in baroque style) and equally interesting is the romanic Cathedral of Saint Sabino. Take a walk along the waterfront%2C on the top of the old city wallsand pass by the Fortino of Saint Antony%2C an old fort recently turned into a modern art gallery%2C and the former Monastery of Saint Scolastica (currently part of the University). The vast majority of the churches in Bari Vecchia are unfortunately closed to tourists. They are open on selected festivities%2C including Good Friday and the Solemnity of All Saints.
Roma,https://wikitravel.org/en/Rome,Water is free at designated water fountains%2C called nasoni (big noses) or simply fontanelle (small fountains). Not only the water's very fresh and good%2C but it comes from the famous springs scattered throughout the Lazio region - it is perfectly safe to drink. If you carry an empty bottle%2C fill it up for the rest of the day; look for the drinking fountain with constant running water%2C plug the bottom hole%2C and cool water will shoot up from a smaller hole on top of the tap. Don't put your lips round the hole at the bottom%2C as stray dogs tend to like to get a drink.
Venice,https://wikitravel.org/en/Venice,To save money at lunch%2C eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe%2C trattoria%2C osteria%2C enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas%2C including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread)%2C bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts%2C polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves%2C and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with%2C in order of bitterness and alcohol content%2C Aperol%2C Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on%2C instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter%2C the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar%2C you'll see 2 columns of numbers%2C accommodating this arrangement. However%2C sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve bread and water for seated patrons%2C but then there is usually also a small charge (€1-3 per person) for "pane e coperto" (bread and cover charge).
Mombasa,https://wikitravel.org/en/Mombasa,For precaution don't drink tap water and be carefull with ice cubes.
