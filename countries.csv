Algeria,https://wikitravel.org/en/Algeria,Tap water is considered drinkable[3] [4]%2C and Algeria enjoys a large variety of excellent mineral bottled water as well.
American Samoa,https://wikitravel.org/en/American_Samoa,In many areas of Tutuila%2C the tap water is not safe for drinking or washing dishes due to E. coli contamination.  Check with the American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency for details or drink bottled water. A gallon of water can be refilled at machines at many stores for 50 cents%2C so do not ruin your holiday by taking the chance with the tap water.
Argentina,https://wikitravel.org/en/Argentina,Visiting Argentina doesn't raise any major health worries.  Certain vaccinations may be necessary for visitors%2C depending on where in Argentina you plan to visit.  Yellow Fever vaccinations are recommended for those visiting the Northern forests. Different climate conditions might take your body by surprise%2C so be aware of the weather before you arrive.  A bout of travellers' diarrhea is the most you're likely to have to worry about as your body adjusts to local micro-organisms in the food. It's also best to ease yourself gently into the local diet – sudden quantities of red meat%2C red wine%2C strong coffee and sweet pastries can be very unsettling for a stomach used to gentler repasts – and though tap water in Argentina is safe to drink%2C if sometimes heavily chlorinated%2C you may prefer to err on the side of caution in rural areas in the north of the country.
Armenia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Armenia,The tap water is generally safe as it comes directly from mountains%2C but you may also purchase bottled water. You can get both mineral water and spring water on almost every street corner in both rural areas and the capital.
Australia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Australia,All cities and towns in Australia have free public toilets. Many parks%2C and most beaches have free electric BBQ's as well. Popular beaches have fresh water showers to wash the salt water off after you swim%2C so for those on a tight budget (or for those that just love waking up at the beach) simply wash in the ocean (please do not pollute the ocean or waterways by using detergents or soaps) and rinse off at the showers. Almost all taps in Australia are drinking water%2C the ones that aren't will be marked. Service stations (petrol/gas) almost always have taps%2C so these are a good place to refill the water containers each time you refuel.
Australia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Australia,If you are caught in a bushfire%2C most fires will pass over quickly. You need to find shelter that will protect you from the smoke and radiant heat. A house is best%2C then a car%2C then a clearing%2C a cave%2C or on the beach is the best location. Wet everything what you can. Stay low and cover your mouth. Cover yourself with non-flammable (woolen) clothing or blankets%2C and reduce the skin directly exposed to the heat. If you have access to a tap gather water early%2C don't rely on water pressure as the fire front approaches. If your holiday goes no further than cities%2C major towns%2C and beaches%2C this won't really concern you.
Australia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Australia,The tap water in Australia is almost always safe to drink%2C and it will be marked on the tap if this is not the case. The taste and hardness of the tap water will vary considerably across the country. Bottled water is also widely available. Carrying water on hot days is a good idea in urban areas%2C and it is a necessity if hiking or driving out of town. At sites where tap water is untreated%2C water sterilization tablets may be used as an alternative to boiling.
Austria,https://wikitravel.org/en/Austria,Tap water is of exceptional quality and safe to drink in Austria (except in some parts of Lower Austria%2C where it is recommended to ask about the water quality first!). The quality of water in Vienna is supposedly comparable to that of Evian.
Bangladesh,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bangladesh,Bangladesh is a fish lover's paradise. Traditionally most of the country lives off of the once-bountiful freshwater river fish%2C especially the officially designated "national fish" Hilsa (kind of Shad fish). The Hilsa has a nice flavour%2C but some may find the many fine bones difficult to manage; if you can master eating this fish%2C consider yourself on par with the locals in fish-eating and deboning expertise.  Various recipes exist for cooking Hilsa%2C suitable for all seasons and all regions of the country. Mutton is also popular%2C as in most Muslim countries%2C as is decidedly lean or hard chicken. Rice is almost always the staple side dish.
Barbados,https://wikitravel.org/en/Barbados,Barbados has some of the purest water in the world that can be drunk straight from the tap. Cruise ship employees are often seen stocking up on their water supplies while docked at the island.
Belgium,https://wikitravel.org/en/Belgium,Tap water is drinkable everywhere in Belgium%2C but most restaurants do not serve it.  Hot spring or some other mineral water is typically served and costs about 4 euro per 1 litter bottle.
Benin,https://wikitravel.org/en/Benin,Watch what you eat/drink and where you eat/drink it. If you are going to eat street food%2C make sure it is served very very hot%2C since bacteria will not live in hot food. The most common causes of sickness is e.coli bacteria found in undercooked meat. Drinking water is readily available%2C if you want bottled water there is "Possatome"- a natural spring water bottled in the city with the same name. It is very good and about 500 CFA a bottle. In Cotonou%2C the tap water is safe to drink but is treated with chlorine which some people may be sensitive to. Malaria is a reality in Benin. Mosquitoes appear from dusk to dawn%2C standing water is conducive to mosquito breeding; and anti-malarial pills are available by prescription only. The only compulsory vaccination needed to enter the country is against Yellow Fever. The customs agents at the airport generally do not check to see if you have it%2C but it is strongly advised to get it before entering for your own health. Along with vaccines against polio%2C hepatitis A and B%2C Measles%2C Mumps%2C Rubella%2C Lock Jaw%2C Rabies and all the other standard childhood vaccines (as per Canadian public school standards). AIDS is an issue in Benin as in all sub-Saharan African countries; use of a condom is highly recommended if entering into a sexual relationship with a Beninese partner. Other risks pertaining to unprotected sex are the same as in any other country whether developed or not: Syphilis%2C Chlamydia%2C HPV%2C etc. If traveling to Benin it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you speak to a doctor who specializes in travel. Ask your family doctor or public health nurse for the name of a travel clinic in your area. Go to them about 6 months prior to travel to Benin if possible. This information is designed as a guide and should not be taken as an expert account on how to stay healthy in Benin%2C only a licensed health professional can provide such information.

Bolivia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bolivia,You can't usually drink tap water in Bolivia. There's plenty of bottled water being sold in the stores. One note though: if you're not a Coca-Cola company (very strong in Bolivia) fan%2C in some towns you may have trouble getting water from other manufacturer.
Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina,Like in much of Europe%2C smoked meats are one of staples of Bosnian cuisine%2C more so even than the stereotypical foods of pita & cevapi. Amongst the non-Muslim populations pork is king%2C and prosciutto%2C smoked neck%2C smoked ribs%2C bacon%2C and hundreds of other varieties of smoked sausage make this a real BBQ and dry-cuts country. The Muslims%2C of course%2C have equally-tasty lamb or beef alternatives. The meat is prepared by first curing in salt for several days%2C which removes water & dehydrates the meat%2C while the high-concentrations of salt preserve the meat from spoiling. After being cleared of salt%2C rubbed with spices (a Bosnian dry rub is usually very simple%2C and includes some combination of high-quality fresh peppercorns%2C hot paprika%2C salt%2C onions & garlic%2C and sometimes with a few spoons of Vegeta%2C a popular powdered all-spice mix similar to an Oxo flavor cube)%2C the meat is then hung over a heavy smoke made by a wood fire. Fruit trees are well-known by BBQ aficionados around the world to produce the most flavorful smoke and apple%2C cherry%2C and walnut trees are the most commonly used in Bosnia. Whereas commercially produced deli meats (of the sort you may buy at your local deli) are most often dry-cured or hung in dehydrating fridges and only then pressure-smoked for a few hours to allow some flavor to permeate the meat%2C Bosnian smoked meat is painstakingly smoked up to three months. The meat hangs in a "smoke house%2C" a tiny wooden shed usually only big enough to light a fire and hang the meat. Bosnians will only smoke meat in the fall or winter%2C because the low temperatures%2C together with the salt curation%2C allow the meat to hang for months without spoiling. During this time%2C it is smoked up to 4 times a week%2C for 8-10 hours at a time%2C which infuses the meat with the flavor of the smoke and removes any remaining water. The finished product has an incredibly strong aroma and flavor of smoke%2C with the texture of chewy beef jerky. Depending on the cut of meat%2C the most noticeable difference between smoked meat produced this way and the commercially produced meat available in North America%2C is the color inside the meat. Whereas commercial deli meat is usually soft%2C red%2C a little wet and fairly raw%2C Bosnian smoked meat is black throughout with only a slight tinge of pink. Larger cuts of meat%2C like the Dalmatian prosciutto%2C do tend to be a bit more pink & softer inside%2C but the difference is still dramatic%2C since the Balkan-made prosciutto has much less water%2C is chewier and overall better smoked. Such meat is most often consumed at breakfast time%2C in sandwiches%2C or as meza%2C a snack platter of meats%2C cheeses%2C peppers%2C Ajvar%2C and other small bites commonly brought out to greet and welcome guests to one's home. For the visitor%2C smoked meats are a cheap and incredibly flavorful lunch meat%2C and can be bought at Bosnian marketplaces from people who usually prepare it themselves. Have a pork neck sandwich with some Bosnian smoked cheese and a salad of fresh tomatoes in a bun of fresh and crisp homemade bread%2C and you'll never want to leave.
Bosnia and Herzegovina,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina,Tap water is safe for drinking around the country. If you're unsure%2C buy bottled water%2C which is cheap to buy.
Botswana,https://wikitravel.org/en/Botswana,Throughout Botswana the tap water is safe to drink (this general advise is taken with care%2C as it varies considerably depending on the area - so make sure you ask locals and travelers alike before drinking it!). Good fruit juice is hard to find (South African 100% juice blends are the norm) although Spar do a range of good juices.  The national beer%2C St Louis%2C is often derided by foreigners as being worse than domestic US lagers. Most opt for Namibian or South African imports.Bottle stores are widely found in most places%2C and even regular%2C slightly bigger supermarkets are allowed to sell booze.
Botswana,https://wikitravel.org/en/Botswana,Water in urban areas is chlorinated%2C and is drunk from the tap by the local population.  Still%2C short term visitors with sensitive stomachs may feel more secure drinking bottled water.  Outside of urban areas%2C the water is untreated and straight from the borehole and poses a slightly higher risk to the traveller.
Brazil,https://wikitravel.org/en/Brazil,Tap water varies from place to place%2C (from contaminated%2C saline or soaked with chlorine to plain drinkable) and Brazilians themselves usually prefer to have it filtered.
Brazil,https://wikitravel.org/en/Brazil,In airports%2C bus stations%2C as well as many of the cheaper hotels%2C it is common to find drinking fountains (bebedouro)%2C although not always safe. In hostel kitchens%2C look for the tap with the cylindrical filter attached. In more expensive hotels%2C there is often no publicly accessible fountain%2C and bedrooms contain minibars — selling you mineral water at extremely inflated prices.
Brunei,https://wikitravel.org/en/Brunei,Eating out is generally safe because of good food safety standards%2C although tap water is not fit for drinking & should be boiled first. Alternatively%2C bottled water is very cheap.
Bulgaria,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria,Being a staple%2C and quite favourite around the country%2C Bulgarian yogurt is also an ingredient in many dishes%2C the most famous one being tarator (таратор)%2C a cold soup made from yoghurt%2C water%2C  cucumbers%2C garlic%2C dill and walnuts. A drink called ayran - a salted yoghurt-water mixture - is also very popular.
Bulgaria,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria,There are more than six hundred mineral water springs around the country%2C so local mineral water is something you should try. In most regions%2C tap water is safe to drink%2C but it is better to ask the locals first.
Bulgaria,https://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria,Tap water in most of Bulgaria is safe to drink%2C and natural mineral water is also cheap and widely available. Since Bulgaria is a mountainous country%2C natural springs are quite abundant and many villages have one or more mineral springs.
Cambodia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cambodia,The tap water supply in Phnom Penh has undergone significant changes following a "water revolutionary" in the government%2C Ek Sonn Chan. Consequently in Phnom Penh it is said that you can drink the tap water without problem%2C although it is highly chlorinated and may be sluiced through old rusty or leaded pipes - drink at your own risk.  Locals usually do not drink the tap water.
Cambodia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cambodia,Outside of Phnom Penh and Siem Reap tap water should be assumed not to be potable. Cambodian branded water in blue plastic bottles sell for 1000 riels or less%2C although prices are often marked up for tourists to 50 cents or a dollar.
Cameroon,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cameroon,Avoid drinking tap water%2C even in restaurants. Bottled water can be found most anywhere at reasonable prices. Expect to pay 400 cfa for 1.5l in the major cities%2C more in more remote areas.
Canada,https://wikitravel.org/en/Canada,You can find most nonalcoholic beverages you would find in any other country. Carbonated beverages (referred to as "pop"%2C "soda" and "soft drinks" in different regions) are very popular. Clean%2C safe drinking water is available from the tap in all cities and towns across Canada. Bottled water is widely sold%2C but it is no better in quality than tap water%2C so you'll save a lot of money by buying a reusable water bottle and filling it up from the tap.
Cape Verde,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cape_Verde,In the resorts%2C the tap water is usually desalinated and safe to drink. In other areas%2C bottled water is cheap and commonly available.
Chile,https://wikitravel.org/en/Chile,Tap water is safe to drink%2C although bottled water is ubiquitous.
China,https://wikitravel.org/en/China,Asking for ice is best avoided. Many%2C perhaps most%2C places just don't have it. The ice they do have may well be made from unfiltered tap water and arguably unsafe for travelers sweating bullets about diarrhea.
China,https://wikitravel.org/en/China,The Chinese do not drink water straight from the tap%2C and tourists should not either. All hotels (even boats) provide either a thermos flask of boiled water in guest rooms (refillable by the floor attendant) or - more commonly - a kettle the guest can use to boil water. Generally%2C tap water is safe to drink after boiling. Purified%2C bottled water is widely available and a small bottle usually costs ¥1. Check that the seal on the cap is not broken. Beer%2C wine and soft drinks are also cheap and safe.
Colombia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Colombia,The water is drinkable straight from the tap in most of the major cities%2C but be prepared to buy some bottles if you go to the countryside. Agua Manantial Bottled water is recommended%2C it comes from a natural spring near Bogotá. Some advice%2C make sure you do not use ice cubes%2C or drink any beverage that might contain non distilled water%2C ask if the beverage is made with tap or bottled/boiled water.
Costa Rica,https://wikitravel.org/en/Costa_Rica,Most places (such as cities) have potable water%2C so don't worry about drinking tap water. Bottled water is also available at low prices. Nevertheless%2C exercise caution about places with doubtful water sources. These places tend to be away from population centers or near the beach/coast.
Costa Rica,https://wikitravel.org/en/Costa_Rica,Tap water in urban areas of the country is almost always safe to drink. However%2C being cautious may be in order in rural areas with questionable water sources.
Croatia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Croatia,Tap water in Croatia is perfectly safe%2C and in some areas considered the best in the world. However%2C you can still choose from several brands of excellent bottled water (Jamnica being the most popular%2C and Jana%2C several times awarded as the world's best bottled water).
Cuba,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cuba,Don't drink tap water. Water in Cuba is generally safe; however%2C it is highly chlorinated to kill all tropical germs. People not accustomed to such chlorine concentration may experience vomiting%2C diarrhea or stomach spasms.
Cuba,https://wikitravel.org/en/Cuba,Cuban milk is usually unpasteurized%2C and can make visitors sick. Additionally%2C tourists should be wary of vegetables washed in tap water. Despite the warnings%2C most Cuban food is safe to eat and you do not need to be paranoid.
Czech Republic,https://wikitravel.org/en/Czech_Republic,Tap water is good and perfectly safe across the country%2C although in some small towns%2C the chlorine can be quite strong.
Denmark,https://wikitravel.org/en/Denmark,Tap water is potable unless indicated. The regulations for tap water in Denmark even exceeds that of bottled water in general%2C so don't be offended if you notice a waiter filling a can of water at the sink. Restaurants and other places selling food are visited regularly by health inspectors and are awarded points on a 1-4 "smiley scale". [67] The ratings must be prominently displayed%2C so look out for the happy face when in doubt. While pollution in the major cities can be annoying it doesn't pose any risk to non-residents. Nearly all beaches are fine for bathing - even parts of the Copenhagen harbour recently opened for bathing (read the Stay safe section).
Dominica,https://wikitravel.org/en/Dominica,There are many vendors of fruit juice in Roseau.  Almost without exception this is non-pasturised fruit juice with water and sugar added.  The added water is usually chlorinated tap water.A juice vendor known as Pal sells his juice by the area where one can find a bus to Portsmouth.  Pal is one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable fruit vendors on the island.  He sometimes has juice from rare fruits.
Dominica,https://wikitravel.org/en/Dominica,Tap water is safe to drink%2C but since it is sometimes drawn straight from Dominica's many rivers%2C it has a tendency to turn brown after heavy rainfall.  It's better to drink the bottled water available almost anywhere.
Dominican Republic,https://wikitravel.org/en/Dominican_Republic,Do not drink tap water! Locals%2C even in the most rural areas%2C will either boil their water or purchase bottled water. Eating salads or other food that may be washed in tap water is not advisable. Ice is a bad idea as well%2C except when in luxury hotels and restaurants (which produce ice from bottled water). If you plan on cooking or washing dishes for longer stays%2C it is a good idea to rinse everything with bottled or boiled water before use. In every community%2C there will be one or more colmados (the same thing as what people in Puerto Rico call bodegas) where you can buy small amounts of everything. Water is sold in bottles at 15 pesos and up; it is also sold in plastic bags (fundas) at 2 for 5 pesos%2C but the best way (by ecological and economic means) to buy drinkable water in the Dominican Republic is to buy a botellón which is a big%2C refillable bottle of water. It costs 50 pesos for a refill of 17 litres (5 gallons)%2C and the canister (botellón) itself costs around 200 pesos. If you stay somewhere for a few days%2C you may ask about buying it just for a few days%2C and you will probably get a full refund when you return it.
Dominican Republic,https://wikitravel.org/en/Dominican_Republic,Avoid drinking local tap water and only drink bottled water or other beverages. It is important for visitors to stay hydrated in the hot%2C humid climate.
Ecuador,https://wikitravel.org/en/Ecuador,Bottled water is very common and is safe to drink; it comes con gas (carbonated) and sin gas (non-carbonated). Water from the tap is unsafe to drink. Even Ecuadorians generally only drink bottled (or boiled) water.
Egypt,https://wikitravel.org/en/Egypt,No matter where you buy bottled water from (even hotels are not entirely reliable)%2C before accepting it check that there is a clear plastic seal on it and the neck ring is still attached to the cap by the breakable threads of plastic. It is common to collect empty but 'new' bottles and refill them with tap water which drinking a bottle of will make you ill. Not all brands have the clear plastic cover but all the good ones do.
Egypt,https://wikitravel.org/en/Egypt,Egyptian tap water is generally considered safe by locals%2C but is not recommended for regular drinking%2C especially to very local differences in quality. Bottled mineral waters are widely available -- see Drink:Water section. Beware of the old scam%2C however%2C whereby vendors re-sell bottled water bottles%2C having refilled with another (perhaps dubious) source.... Always check the seal is unbroken before parting with your money (or drinking from it) and inform the tourist police if you catch anyone doing this....
El Salvador,https://wikitravel.org/en/El_Salvador,Ameobas and other parasites are commonly in tap and well water%2C so beware of where you buy your drinks and what your ice looks like.  A good rule of thumb is that if the ice is molded (i.e. round cylinders with a hole in the middle%2C or perfect squares) it is usually purified water bought from a store and therefore safe to have in your drink.  If it looks like it has been broken apart with an ice pick it's suspect.  In Puerto La Libertad%2C many commodores (local restaurants often operating out of someone's house) get their ice from the fishing co-op on the beachfront street.  When you see what else that ice comes in contact with%2C you will change your mind about drinks with chipped ice in them!
Eritrea,https://wikitravel.org/en/Eritrea,Tap water should not be drunk by foreigners. There is plenty of relatively cheap bottled mineral water%2C both carbonated and non-carbonated in Eritrea.
Eritrea,https://wikitravel.org/en/Eritrea,Do not drink the tap water and even check bottled water to make sure the cap is sealed. Be very careful what you eat. Many people get sick here. There is a Jordanian UN hospital that will treat foreigners. Local hospitals have inadequate facilities. Be healthy if you come here. Avoid uncooked food and unbottled drinks.
Estonia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Estonia,Tap water is drinkable everywhere unless in the rare cases a sign has been posted that it is not.
Ethiopia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Ethiopia,Do not drink tap water. Bottled water for drinking is available almost everywhere in small%2C medium and big bottles. Addis tap water is better than in many other cities%2C but even the hotels generally recommend that guests do not drink it%2C nor eat salads or other uncooked food that is commonly washed in tap water. However%2C do make sure you drink enough water%2C especially when the weather is hot.
Fiji,https://wikitravel.org/en/Fiji,Fiji is relatively free of disease compared to most of the tropics. Avoid mosquito-borne illnesses%2C such as dengue fever and even elephantiasis by covering up thoroughly or using repellents while outdoors at dawn or dusk. Local water is generally safe%2C though filtering or boiling is advisable when unsure. Urban tap water is treated and nearly always safe. When exceptions occasionally arise%2C there are public warnings or radio and print media warnings. Contaminated food is uncommon%2C though on occasion%2C mature reef fish can contain mild neurotoxins they accumulate in their bodies from freshwater algaes that wash into the ocean. The effects of such "fish-poisoning" are usually intense for only a day or two%2C but tingling lips and unusual sensitivities to hot and cold can linger for a long time.
Finland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Finland,Thanks to its thousands of lakes%2C Finland has plenty of water supplies and tap water is always potable (In fact%2C never buy bottled water if you can get tap water!).  The usual soft drinks and juices are widely available%2C but look out for a wide array of berry juices (marjamehu)%2C especially in summer%2C as well as Pommac%2C an unusual soda made from (according to the label) "mixed fruits"%2C which you'll either love or hate.
Finland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Finland,You're unlikely to have stomach troubles in Finland%2C since tap water is always drinkable (and generally quite tasty as well)%2C and hygiene standards in restaurants are strict. If you have any sort of allergies%2C many restaurants often display in the menu the most common ingredients that people typically are allergic to. Examples: (L) = Lactose free%2C (VL) = Low Lactose%2C (G) = Gluten free%2C if you are unsure just ask the waitress or restaurant staff.
France,https://wikitravel.org/en/France,Fixed price menus seldom include beverages (if drinks are included%2C the menu will state 'boisson comprise'). If you want water%2C waiters will often try to sell you still mineral water (Évian%2C Thonon) or sparkling water (Badoit%2C Perrier)%2C at a premium; ask for a carafe d'eau (bottle of tap water)%2C which is safe to drink (and%2C by law%2C must be provided free of charge when you order food at a restaurant). Water never comes with ice in it unless so requested (and water with ice may not be available).
France,https://wikitravel.org/en/France,Tap water (Eau du robinet) is drinkable%2C except in rare cases such as rural rest areas and sinks in train bathrooms%2C in which case it will be clearly signposted as Eau non potable. Eau potable is potable water. (You may%2C however%2C not like the taste which may be chlorinated%2C bottled water is common.)
Germany,https://wikitravel.org/en/Germany,Tap water has a good quality%2C is very strictly controlled and can be freely used for consumption. Exceptions have to be labelled ("Kein Trinkwasser" = not drinking water)%2C usually found on fountains and in trains.
Ghana,https://wikitravel.org/en/Ghana,Drinking water from the tap is not generally considered to be safe%2C so choices include plastic bottled water (eg. Voltic%2C 1.5 litre%2C c. GHS1.00)%2C boiled or filtered tap water%2C and "pure water" sachets. These sachets are filtered and come in 500mL portions. At least one study has suggested bottled water to be the safest choice.   Although "pure water" sachets are more easily accessible and very cheaper (10 pesawas each)%2C 2.3% of sachets tested were found to contain faecal bacteria. If you want to play it safe%2C stick with carbonated beverages or bottled water.
Greece,https://wikitravel.org/en/Greece,Tap water in most places a traveller would go today is drinkable; if in doubt%2C ask your hotel. But often though technically drinkable it doesn't taste very good%2C especially on some small islands (as it is imported in and heavily chlorinated)%2C and many travellers%2C like many Greeks%2C prefer to stick to bottled water. By law%2C water prices in shops must remain within acceptable and very cheap limits (50 eurocents for 1/2 litre)%2C making it much cheaper than in Anglosphere nations.
Guinea,https://wikitravel.org/en/Guinea,Water bottled in the name of Coyah is available everywhere for about USD0.50 per 1.5 litre bottle and is very good. Conakry's tap water is generally not safe unless filtered/boiled.
Guyana,https://wikitravel.org/en/Guyana,Guyana embodies gastronomical lineage from the Chinese%2C Indians%2C Pakistanis%2C Africans%2C Portuguese%2C Dutch%2C British and the Indigenous Peoples. While the big cities like Georgetown and Lethem have ample restaurants and bars for global and local cuisines%2C the authentic flavours of Guyana are best sampled in the inland areas.  Plan to sample indigenous foods such as cassava bread%2C farine with tuma pot (a meat dish that is cooked in cassava water with a variety of spices) and tasso (preserved salted beef strips). In the city restaurants%2C you can find flavours from Indian kitchens (rice-curry combos are staple)%2C Chinese cuisines and International fare. Some of the popular restaurants include Backyard Café%2C The Bottle Bar and Restaurant at Cara Lodge%2C and the Caribe Boardwalk Pool Bar & Grill%2C Great Room and the Terra Mare Restaurant at the Marriott.
Guyana,https://wikitravel.org/en/Guyana,Do not drink the tap water%2C unless you want to spend a great part of your vacation on the toilet! Bottled water is readily available in a variety of brands.
Haiti,https://wikitravel.org/en/Haiti,Tap water should be avoided. Drink bottled water only.
Haiti,https://wikitravel.org/en/Haiti,Sanitary conditions in Haiti are poor. Tap water should be avoided. Drink bottled water only.
Hong Kong,https://wikitravel.org/en/Hong_Kong,Tap water in Hong Kong has been proven to be drinkable%2C although most of the local people still prefer to boil and chill their drinking water when it is taken from the tap. The official advice from the Water Board is that the water is perfectly safe to drink unless you are living in an old building with outdated plumbing and poorly maintained water tanks. Bottled water is strongly recommended by locals but remember that Hong Kong's landfill sites are filling up fast and plastic bottles are a major environmental problem%2C so use recycling bins where provided.
Hungary,https://wikitravel.org/en/Hungary,Thermal waters abound in Hungary with over 1000 thermal springs in the country (more than 100 just in the Budapest area) many of which have been turned into baths and spas. The most famous being the Szechenyi baths in Budapest. It was completed in 1913 and built in Modern Renaissance style. This is the biggest thermal bath complex in Europe%2C its venue is the Budapest City Park. There are%2C however%2C hundreds of individual baths all around the country. The cave baths at Miskolc-Tapolca and the spa at Egerszalók are some nice examples. The first thermal baths were erected by the Romans more than 2000 years ago.
Hungary,https://wikitravel.org/en/Hungary,It should be noted though that as it is the case of most European countries%2C in Hungary it is safe to drink tap water anywhere%2C even in 'remote' settings. Bottled waters are offered in a large selection%2C both the fizzy (blue bottle cap buborékos) and still (red/pink bottle cap) water and it is cheap (starts from less than 100 HUF for one and half liter). The only notable exception of the drinking water are trains where the tap water is not drinkable and other places where tap water is labeled as such.
Iceland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Iceland,Tap water is safe to drink in Iceland and it has some of the cleanest water in the world. Coffee is easy to find and is comparable to what is found throughout Europe. Juices are generally imported and made from concentrate.
Iceland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Iceland,If you're travelling on a budget%2C camping is your best bet. There are sites located throughout the country%2C especially at places you'd want to visit. They range from fully-equipped (hot showers%2C washing machines%2C cooking facilities) to farmers' fields with a cold-water tap. Expect to pay 500-1000 Kr per person per night.  If you intend to camp in Iceland you must be prepared for the cold%2C 3 season sleeping bags are essential and an inner%2C I would also highly recommend thick pyjamas and a warm hat! A bedding roll is also useful as you may end up sleeping on very rough ground...and that's just not very comfortable at all!  Don't wait until last minute to find a place to camp. Campers and mobile homes have become immensely popular among Icelanders and they take up a lot of space. You could arrive at a large camping ground that's so filled up with campers and mobile homes that you'll have no place to pitch your tent.
Iceland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Iceland,The water quality in Iceland is excellent and tap water is always drinkable.
India (Hindustan),https://wikitravel.org/en/India,As for bottled water%2C make sure that the cap's seal has not been broken%2C otherwise%2C it is a tell tale sign of tampering or that unscrupulous vendors reuse old bottles and fill them with tap water%2C which is generally unsafe for foreign tourists to drink without prior boiling.  Bottled water brands like Aquafina (by PepsiCo) and Kinley (by Coca-Cola) are widely available.  Local brands like Bisleri are also acceptable and perfectly safe.  Tastes may vary due to the individual brands' mineral contents. Avoid most locally sold soft drinks and soda's%2C they are known to have strong dyes and chemicals and can lead to nausea%2C diarrhea%2C and headache.
India (Hindustan),https://wikitravel.org/en/India,Tap water is generally not considered safe for drinking at many installations%2C even by local populace. However%2C many establishments have water filters/purifiers installed%2C in which case the water may be safe to drink. Packed drinking water (popularly called "mineral water" throughout India) is a better choice. Bisleri and Kinley among others are some of the more popular and safe brands. However%2C please check for whether the seal is intact or not as on some occasions%2C if the seal has been tampered%2C it could be nothing but purified tap water or worse%2C unfiltered water. On Indian Railways%2C a particular mineral water brand is generally available known as "Rail Neer"%2C which is considered to be safe and pure.
India (Hindustan),https://wikitravel.org/en/India,Fruits that can be peeled such as apples and bananas%2C as well as packaged snacks are always a safe option. As is the practice with the native population%2C always wash the fruits and vegetables prior to cooking%2C with water. Municipality provided running tap water is generally considered safe to do so and this should not pose any later harm.
Indonesia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Indonesia,Tap water is generally not potable in Indonesia. Water or ice served to you in restaurants may have been purified and/or boiled (air minum or air putih)%2C but do ask.  Bottled water%2C usually known as Aqua after the best-known brand%2C is cheap and available everywhere%2C but check that the seal is intact.
Indonesia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Indonesia,Most hotels provide free drinking water because tap water is rarely potable.  Do not use tap water for brushing your teeth.  Also beware of ice which may not have been prepared with potable water or kept in hygienic conditions.
Iran,https://wikitravel.org/en/Iran,Tap water is safe to drink in most of the country (and especially the cities)%2C although you may find the chalkiness and taste off-putting in some areas (mainly Qom%2C Yazd%2C Hormozgan and Boushehr provinces).  Bottled mineral water (āb ma'dani) is widely available. Also%2C on many streets and sites%2C public water fridges are installed to provide drinking water.
Iraq,https://wikitravel.org/en/Iraq,As a walk past an Iraqi butcher shop will demonstrate%2C food preparation standards are not the same as in Western countries%2C and consumption of local food can make a visitor ill.  Try to bring your own.  As tap water is generally not potable%2C you should especially avoid uncooked foods.
Israel,https://wikitravel.org/en/Israel,Tap water is potable and perfectly safe for drinking all throughout Israel%2C big cities and rural parts alike.
Italy,https://wikitravel.org/en/Italy,While safe to drink%2C the tap water in some parts of Italy (e.g. Sardinia%2C or parts of the South) can be cloudy with a slight off taste. Some Italians prefer bottled water%2C which is served in restaurants; make sure you let the waiter/waitress know you want regular water (acqua naturale or acqua liscia) or else you could get water with either natural gas (acqua effervescente) or with added carbonation (acqua frizzante or acqua gassata); usually the waiter will ask which one you want with phrases like "Liscia/naturale o gassata/frizzante?" (Still or sparkling water?). Rome%2C in particular%2C has exceptional pride in the quality of its water. This goes right back to the building of aqueducts channeling pure mountain water to every citizen during Roman times. Don't waste plastic bottles! You can refill your drinking containers and bottles at any of the constant running taps and fountains dotted around the city%2C safe in the knowledge that you are getting excellent quality cool spring water - try it!
Italy,https://wikitravel.org/en/Italy,Water in southern Italy might come from desalination and sometimes may have a strange taste%2C due to extended droughts. If in doubt use bottled water. Elsewhere tap water is perfectly drinkable and very well maintained. Or else%2C a "NON POTABILE" warning is posted.
Jamaica,https://wikitravel.org/en/Jamaica,The tap water is generally good and safe to drink. All piped water in Jamaica is treated to international standards%2C and will be of the same quality you could expect to find in North America or Europe. Water service in rural areas can sometimes go out for several hours at a time. People in rural areas have their own water tanks%2C which catch water when it rains%2C so be ready to draw from a tank instead of turning a pipe. Water from these sources should be boiled before being consumed. Bottled water such as Wata (a local brand)%2C Aquafina and Deer Park are widely available.
Japan,https://wikitravel.org/en/Japan,Japan is a country obsessed with cleanliness and health hazards are few and far between. Tap water is potable everywhere and food hygiene standards are very high. There are no communicable diseases of significance%2C as despite the name%2C Japanese encephalitis has been almost eradicated.
Kenya,https://wikitravel.org/en/Kenya,People staying longer-term may rent accommodation; prices range from estate-agent 'international style' rentals at USD150+ pw%2C to privately arranged furnished apartments%2C from USD50-100 pw%2C to 'local' style accommodation%2C usually unfurnished%2C in a price range from KES5000-7000 per month with windows%2C water%2C electricity%2C down to KES 500 per month with no windows%2C no electricity%2C loud neighbours%2C mosquitoes%2C shared access to a tap. To arrange privately rented accommodation%2C you'll need to ask around - cab drivers%2C shopkeepers%2C market traders%2C could all save you the estate agents' fees.
Kuwait,https://wikitravel.org/en/Kuwait,Tap water is drinkable%2C although most of it is desalinated.  Bottled water is available everywhere for a few hundred fils. Alcohol is illegal in Kuwait: it may not be imported%2C manufactured or served.
Laos,https://wikitravel.org/en/Laos,Pakse is a good place to rent and plan a trip around the deep south (know as 'the southern loop') to places like Tad Lo (a multi-tiered waterfall with an old rustic village built next to it)%2C Sekong and Attapeu; all are very possible to do on a simple 110cc scooter as all the roads are paved%2C quiet and in generally good condition.
Laos,https://wikitravel.org/en/Laos,Tap water is not drinkable%2C but bottled water is cheap and widely available.
Latvia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Latvia,Tap water is safe to drink; however%2C most locals prefer to boil it before drinking. Purchasing bottled water is an alternative.
Lithuania,https://wikitravel.org/en/Lithuania,Tap water is suitable for drinking in many parts of Lithuania. In other areas%2C local people prefer to purchase bottled water or to run tap water through water filters. If you need to buy bottled water%2C a 5 litre bottle is not much more expensive than a one litre bottle. Where in doubt about the tap water%2C seek local advice.
Lithuania,https://wikitravel.org/en/Lithuania,Mineral water is also offered in restaurants%2C cafés and shops%2C although it's a bit more expensive than tap water. Some popular brands are Rasa%2C Tichė and Vytautas.
Luxembourg,https://wikitravel.org/en/Luxembourg,The food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country's healthcare system is first class. The climate is average even though the summers can get hot. However these temperatures rarely rise much above 30°C.
Macau,https://wikitravel.org/en/Macau,Whilst tap water is technically safe to drink (taste aside)%2C most locals boil or filter their water or buy inexpensive bottled water%2C which you are also recommended to do so. A 2.5 litre bottle of drinking water starts around $0.25 in supermarkets.
Madagascar,https://wikitravel.org/en/Madagascar,While in general tap water is considered not safe%2C in most cities it seldom causes problems. Bottled water costs 30 to 60 eurocent per liter and can be found almost everywhere. The same holds for Fanta%2C Coca Cola%2C ... Bonbon Anglais%2C and various beers like Three Horses Beer (THB)%2C Castel%2C Queens%2C Skol%2C ... Locals often drink rum because it is much cheaper than beer.Natural and not so natural juices can also readily be found%2C for 5 to 10 eurocent per cup. Another option is ranon'apango (RAN-oo-na-PANG-oo) or rice water (water used to cook rice%2C which will therefore have been boiled) which is often served when eating in local places. It's particularly important to plan ahead if visiting rural areas. It is worth taking with you some chlorine tablets%2C which can be used to make the local water drinkable.
Malawi,https://wikitravel.org/en/Malawi,Traditional Malawian food revolves around one staple%2C maize%2C served in one form%2C nsima (n'SEE-ma).  Nsima is basically a type of thick porridge%2C rolled into balls with your right hand and dipped into a variety of stews known as relishes.  Those who can afford them eat relishes of beef%2C chicken or fish%2C but the many who can't make do with beans%2C tiny dried fish (usipa)%2C pumpkin leaves (chibwabwa) and other vegetables.  At breakfast%2C nsima can be served watered down into a soup%2C maybe with a little sugar.  Local restaurants will serve nsima and relish for less than MWK2000 (USD3).
Malawi,https://wikitravel.org/en/Malawi,Tap water in major cities like Lilongwe%2C Blantyre%2C Zomba and Mzuzu is generally safe. Ask at the lodge/house you're at. Some travellers with weaker stomachs may be advised to avoid this drinking water. Bottled water is plentiful in all the major shops.
Malaysia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Malaysia,Generally%2C you can eat pretty much anywhere in Malaysia. Food outlets are comparatively clean - the only thing you should avoid is ice for your drinks%2C when you frequent the street stalls since the blocks of ice used there might not be up to your hygienic standards.  In actual restaurants this is not a problem. Also you might want to avoid ordering water from stalls or the mamak restaurants as they are usually unboiled tap water.
Malaysia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Malaysia,Tap water is drinkable straight off the tap as it is treated (depending on location)%2C but even locals boil or filter it first just to be on the safe side. When travelling it is best to stick to bottled water%2C which is very affordable.
Malaysia,https://wikitravel.org/en/Malaysia,Ice in drinks might be made from tap water but nowadays%2C most restaurants and even roadside stalls use the cylindrical variety with a hollow tube down the middle that are mass-produced at ice factories and are safer to consume.
Maldives,https://wikitravel.org/en/Maldives,Tap water in resorts may or may not be drinkable -- check with management.  Bottled water in the resorts is extortionately priced%2C with USD5/bottle being typical. Bottled water in Malé City or on an island is much cheaper. It can be a good idea to bring a few 5 litre bottles from Malé City to your resort if you have the option.
Maldives,https://wikitravel.org/en/Maldives,There are no serious problems with diseases in the Maldives. Beware that tap water may not be drinkable at all resorts: enquire locally. The Maldives are malaria-free%2C but some islands do have mosquitoes and catching dengue fever from them is possible%2C albeit highly unlikely. For those coming from regions infected by yellow fever%2C an international certificate of inoculation is required.
Mali,https://wikitravel.org/en/Mali,Treat tap water with suspicion. It is often so heavily chlorinated that one suspects few bugs could possibly survive in it. But short-term visitors will be safer with bottled water. There are several cheap local brands%2C but be warned that they are only drunk by foreigners and wealthy Malians: don't rely on finding bottled water in shops patronised by "ordinary" Malians. Soft drinks such as Coca-Cola or Fanta are more widely available and safe. But remember that Coke will make you want to go to the toilet%2C and so may leave you more dehydrated than before you drank it - a serious problem in this stunningly hot country.  Street vendors sell water and home-made ginger and berry drinks in little plastic bags.  They are often iced which makes them very refreshing in the heat.  Generally%2C you shouldn't drink these without treating them first.  However%2C one which is called "bissap" in French and "dabileni" ("red hybiscus") in Bambara%2C is made from hibiscus flowers that are boiled during preparation%2C and so generally is safe to drink.  It is a particularly delicious non-alcoholic drink you shouldn't miss.  In Bamako%2C it is possible to purchase at most corner stores treated water in small plastic bags for XOF50;  these are much cheaper%2C and of course more environmentally friendly%2C than bottles.  The bags are marked with a brand name;  be careful not to mistake them for the tap water that is sold in unmarked plastic bags by street vendors.  Also widely sold in this way is sweet milk and yoghurt%2C which are normally clean because the bags are industrially filled. Fresh milk can also be bought from buckets at the roadside in some villages%2C although it should always be thoroughly boiled before drinking as it can carry tuberculosis bacteria (often Malians do this before selling%2C but it is safer to do it yourself or at least ask).
Martinique,https://wikitravel.org/en/Martinique,As in France%2C water is safe to drink from the tap%2C and restaurants will happily serve this at no extra charge (l'eau du robinet).
Mexico,https://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico,Non alcoholic beverages:Tap water is potable%2C but generally not recommended for drinking. Some exaggerated people even claim that tap water is not good for brushing teeth. Hotels usually give guests one (large) bottle of drinking water per room per night. Bottled water is also readily available in supermarkets and at tourist attractions. Another drink is called Chamaica it is Hibisicus juice.
Mexico,https://wikitravel.org/en/Mexico,Some parts of Mexico are known for travellers' diarrhea that it is often called "Montezuma's Revenge" (Venganza de Moctezuma). The reason for this is not so much the spicy food but the contamination of the water supply in some of the poorer zones in Mexico. In most of the small towns that are less industrialized%2C only the poorest Mexicans will drink tap water. The best policy is to only drink bottled or purified water%2C both of which are readily available. Be sure to specify bottled water in restaurants and avoid ice (which is often not made from purified water) in non-alcohol drinks. Just like in the USA%2C in most major Mexican cities the water is purified at the cities' water company. In most restaurants in these poor zones%2C the only water served comes from large jugs of purified water. If you get sick%2C visit your local clinic as soon as possible. There is medicine available that will counter the bacteria.
Morocco,https://wikitravel.org/en/Morocco,As a rule%2C do not drink tap water at all in Morocco%2C even in hotels%2C as it contains much higher levels of minerals than the water in Europe. For local people this is not a problem as their bodies are used to this and can cope%2C but for travellers from places such as Europe%2C drinking the tap water will usually result in illness. Generally this is not serious%2C an upset stomach being the only symptom%2C but it is enough to spoil a day or two of your holiday.
Mozambique,https://wikitravel.org/en/Mozambique,All tap water in Mozambique should be assumed to be unsafe to drink%2C even if it is not harmful it usually has some sediment that your stomach will not be used to. Most western oriented lodgings either provide a fresh water source or sell bottled water.
Myanmar,https://wikitravel.org/en/Myanmar,Tap water in Myanmar is not safe to drink. Most restaurants%2C with the possible exception of roadside stalls%2C now use packaged ice made from bottled water%2C so ice should be safe. When out and about%2C even the locals drink bottled water and that's your safest option. Bottled water is readily available just about everywhere. As of May 2013%2C the standard going rate is MYK300 for a 1L bottle of mineral water.
Myanmar,https://wikitravel.org/en/Myanmar,Hygiene in Myanmar may seem terrible to the average Western traveler but it is possible to stay healthy with some basic precautions such as prophylactic medication%2C care choosing food and water%2C and antibacterial ointment. Never drink tap water. Restaurants are legally required to use ice made and sold by bottled water companies%2C so ordering ice is usually safe in major places. Always drink bottled water and check that the cap is sealed on%2C not simply screwed on. Diseases such as dengue fever%2C Japanese encephalitis and malaria are endemic. Drug-resistant strains of malaria and tuberculosis are common in many areas. Hepatitis vaccinations are highly recommended and cholera oral vaccine is worthwhile. At the dinner table%2C Burmese use a spoon and fork%2C or their fingers when this is more convenient. You might feel better rinsing all of them before meals. Antibacterial wipes or alcohol hand-rub is a good idea at regular intervals.
Myanmar,https://wikitravel.org/en/Myanmar,As in any other developing country: "if you can't fry%2C roast%2C peel or boil it - then forget it". Wash your hands frequently with soap and water (tap water is OK for hand washing). Always have hand sanitizer ready%2C since most germs are spread through hand contact.
Nepal,https://wikitravel.org/en/Nepal,Prithvi Narayan's heirs Pratap Singh%2C Rana Bahadur and Girvan Yuddha continued expansion of their kingdom into the Koshi river basin east of the Bagmati system. Like the Gandaki%2C the Koshi traditionally has seven major tributaries descending from the Himalayas before joining forces to break through the Mahabharat and Siwalik ranges. Ranges drained by Koshi tributaries include Mount Everest and its neighbouring peaks%2C as well as the western side of the Kangchenjunga massif.  Kangchenjunga and a high ridge to the south are the watershed between the Koshi and Tista basins as well as the border between Nepal and the former kingdom of Sikkim that India annexed in 1975.
New Zealand,https://wikitravel.org/en/New_Zealand,Bottled water%2C both flavoured and unflavoured%2C is available in most shops. Not that there is anything wrong with the tap water%2C it is just that some town supplies are drawn from river water and chlorinated. Most town supplies are fluoridated. If you do not want to pour your money down the drain%2C fill your own water bottle from the tap%2C unless you find it is too heavily chlorinated for your taste.
New Zealand,https://wikitravel.org/en/New_Zealand,Tap water in New Zealand is regarded as some of the cleanest in the world; it is safe to drink from in all cities%2C most come from artesian wells or freshwater reservoirs - however%2C some are from rivers which can be chlorinated to be made safe but do not taste very nice. Some of the water in Auckland comes from the Waikato river%2C a long river that has its source in Lake Taupo in the centre of the North Island. But by the time it reaches Auckland%2C it has been treated so that the quality is no worse than that of the Thames in London or the Hudson in New York. Auckland water is also drawn from run-off reservoirs in the Waitakere and Hunua Ranges. Tap water in places such as Christchurch and Hastings is not chlorinated at all as it is drawn from the pure artesian aquifers of the Canterbury and Heretaunga plains.
New Zealand,https://wikitravel.org/en/New_Zealand,New Zealand has high and equitable standards of professional health care comparable with Sweden or Australia. Tap water is drinkable but precautions should be taken against Giardia when tramping.
Nicaragua,https://wikitravel.org/en/Nicaragua,According to the US State Department's Consular Sheet for Nicaragua%2C the tap water in Managua is safe to drink%2C but bottled water with chlorine is always the best choice. The water in Esteli is especially good as it comes from deep wells. Bottled water is readily available%2C with a gallon at a supermarket around an American dollar.
Niger,https://wikitravel.org/en/Niger,Drink lots and lots of water while in Niger because the dry heat will dehydrate you and you won't realize it.  It is the best preventative step you can take.  Bottled water or water sealed in a bag (called pure-wata) is available in most of the cities but in a pinch%2C city tap water is well-chlorinated (this is according to one traveler; another American who lived in Niger for two years says never drink unfiltered water anywhere! — that includes ice!). Be particularly wary of well water%2C stream water%2C and rural water.
Niue,https://wikitravel.org/en/Niue,Snorkelling is an alternative to diving. The Utuko Reef in Alofi and the reef pools at Hio Beach are excellent for beginners. Further north from Hio there's a pair of giant natural pools at Matapa that are best at low tide. Around the island there are places to snorkel outside the reef but should only be attempted by confident swimmers; in any case%2C seek local advice and check water conditions before venturing off on your own. To be completely safe%2C go with a partner or take a tour. Niue Dive operates snorkelling trips to sites around the island%2C including Snake Gully. You can also snorkel and swim with spinner dolphins (April to December) and humpback whales (June to October).
Northern Mariana Islands,https://wikitravel.org/en/Northern_Mariana_Islands,Tap water on Saipan is too salty to drink.
Norway,https://wikitravel.org/en/Norway,Take care when buying alcohol and tobacco. It will most certainly be more expensive than you expect. A 400 or 500 mL beer in a pub or restaurant will cost around NOK80 whilst a 500 mL can of 4.7% beer in a supermarket costs about NOK30. Cigarettes cost about NOK115 for a pack of 20%2C and a bottle of 500 mL Coke will usually cost NOK20. On the positive side: Norway has good quality tap water. Buying bottled drinking water is unnecessary and hugely expensive. Some Norwegians drink straight from streams when hiking%2C but periodic outbreaks of Tularemia makes this a bit risky.
Norway,https://wikitravel.org/en/Norway,Food safety is very good in Norway. Salmonella is very rare compared to other countries%2C and health officials inspect restaurants at a regular basis. Also tap-water is usually very nice; Voss water from Vatnestrøm in Aust-Agder is actually exported abroad%2C including to the USA.
Oman,https://wikitravel.org/en/Oman,Bottled drinking (mineral) water is easily available at most stores. Tap water is generally safe; however%2C most Omanis drink bottled water and to be safe%2C you should too.
Pakistan,https://wikitravel.org/en/Pakistan,Tap water can be unsafe for drinking. However%2C some establishments have water filters/purifiers installed%2C in which case the water is safe to drink. Packed drinking water (normally called mineral water in Pakistan) is a better choice.
Pakistan,https://wikitravel.org/en/Pakistan,Visitors are strongly advised to refrain from drinking tap water; many Pakistani locals themselves drink boiled or purified water. Take every precaution to drink only boiled%2C filtered or bottled water. Tap water is known to contain many impurities. Ice is usually made from regular tap-water%2C and may be even harder to avoid. Fresh milk from the carrier should be boiled and cooled before consumption. Non-pasteurized dairy can spread tuberculosis so be careful of people with hacking coughs. Haleeb Milk and Olpers are trusted brands and are available at most grocery stores.
Panama,https://wikitravel.org/en/Panama,Tap water is safe in virtually all cities and towns%2C with the exception of Bocas del Toro%2C where bottled water is recommended.
Papua New Guinea,https://wikitravel.org/en/Papua_New_Guinea,Flightseeing is a word that should have been coined here. If you can afford it%2C just flying around some of the remote airstrips is an adventure in itself. There are strips that seem impossibly short%2C strips that seem to end with a mountain%2C strips where if you don't take off in time you will plunge into a ravine%2C and airstrips surrounded on three sides by water. From Port Moresby you don't have to fly far to get the experience. There are flights to villages on the Kokoda trail and others in the Owen Stanley mountain range in Central Province and you can fly a scheduled circuit or "milk run" in one morning%2C although you will have to be at the airport by 5:00 a.m. Check with Airlines PNG for schedules. Fane%2C Ononge and Tapini strips are particularly scary. Remember your life insurance.
Papua New Guinea,https://wikitravel.org/en/Papua_New_Guinea,Tap water in most regions is unsafe to drink.
Paraguay,https://wikitravel.org/en/Paraguay,Tap water in Asuncion%2C and for sure Ciudad del Este%2C is NOT potable! Tap water in the rest of Paraguay should be treated to make it safe for drinking. There have been efforts by PLAN International to bring safe%2C potable water to communities in rural areas (if there is such water available%2C it is safe to drink). Ask before drinking water in rural areas however--many Paraguayans will claim their water is safe to drink even if it's not purified.
Peru,https://wikitravel.org/en/Peru,Tap water.Drink water only when you are certain it is safe. Don't drink tap water. If you are using tap water to brush your teeth or rinse your mouth%2C spit as much out as possible. Tap water can be made drinkable by boiling it (bringing it to boiling point in a kettle should be sufficient) or by purification methods such as iodine tablets or UV light. Bottled water is cheap and tastes better than boiled water. Check the bottle to make sure that it has not been opened and refilled. In restaurants%2C (if you don't trust them) you could request the bottle to be opened in your presence and never take ice in your drinks (ice cubes are often made with tap water). Remember%2C alcohol does not make tap water drinkable!
Philippines,https://wikitravel.org/en/Philippines,Metro Manila is home to many bars%2C watering holes%2C and karaoke sites.  Popular places include Makati (particularly the Glorietta and Greenbelt areas)%2C Ortigas Metrowalk%2C and Eastwood in Libis. Other big cities such as Cebu City and Davao also have areas where the nightlife is centered. Establishments serve the usual hard and soft drinks typical of bars elsewhere. Note that Filipinos rarely consume alcohol by itself. They would normally have what is called as "pulutan" or bar chow alongside their drinks which is like the equivalent of tapas. At the least%2C this would consist of mixed nuts but selections of grilled meats and seafood are not uncommon food alongside the customary drinks. When having a party%2C Filipinos enjoy drinking round-robin style using a common glass. One is supposed to drink bottoms-up before passing the glass to the next person. This custom is known as "tagayan" and one person usually volunteers to pour the drink.
Philippines,https://wikitravel.org/en/Philippines,Drink the readily available bottled water. Buko (young coconut) juice is also safe if they have not added local ice to it. Be wary also of Buko juice vendors%2C some usually just add sugar to water. Buy and eat fruit that has not already been cut up. Cooked food from a karenderia (outdoor canteen) is okay if there is a fire under the pots and the food has been kept hot. If you must drink tap water (it is usually served/contained in a small to medium plastic bag)%2C water in Manila%2C Cebu City and other major cities%2C but it is recommended that you boil tap water for at least 5 minutes just to be safe. Elsewhere drink bottled water. There is always the risk of contracting amoebiasis when drinking tap water in the countryside. Also%2C this applies to ice that is usually put in beverages. Bottled water is best purchased from within stores and sheltered eateries. Bottled waters sold outside (by the roads) are more than likely used bottles filled with tap water%2C sealed then cooled. Be careful of drinking pampalamig (cold drinks like Sago't Gulaman) as some of the vendors might be using Magic Sugar(formally called Sodium Cyclamate); an artificial sweetener%2C which has been banned by the Philippine Government because of its adverse effects on health such as higher risk of getting cancer by consuming Magic sugar%2C it has been used as an alternative to ordinary sugar as it is much cheaper%2C call 911 (Philippine National Police) if you encounter such situation. Streetfood isn't so safe to consume in the Philippines%2C hygienic standards aren't enforced much. It is better to eat streetfood as well as pampalamig inside malls and shopping centers than in streets as stalls in malls and shopping centers have better enforcement of cleanliness.
Poland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Poland,Drinking water with a meal is not a Polish tradition; having a tea or coffee afterwards is much more common. If you want water with a meal%2C you might need to ask for it - and you will usually get a choice of carbonated (gazowana) or still (niegazowana) bottled water%2C rather than a glass of tap water. As a result water is never free%2C and is pretty expensive too compared to the average price of a meal (about 4zl for one glass). Beware that even "still" bottled water%2C while not visibly bubbly%2C will still contain some carbon dioxide.
Poland,https://wikitravel.org/en/Poland,For travellers preferring to drink water from the tap%2C tap water is safe and drinkable across the country.
Puerto Rico,https://wikitravel.org/en/Puerto_Rico,Tap water is treated and is officially safe to drink%2C though it tastes rather chlorinated; many opt for bottled water instead.
Puerto Rico,https://wikitravel.org/en/Puerto_Rico,Tap water may be unsafe to drink in Puerto Rico. When spending the day walking in the hot tropical sun it is important to stay hydrated. Ask for bottled water at restaurants%2C bars%2C hotels.
Puerto Rico,https://wikitravel.org/en/Puerto_Rico,Fresh water lakes and streams in metropolitan areas are often polluted so avoid going in for a dip.

Other agriculture sectors include root crops like taro%2C tapioca%2C sweet potatoes%2C yams%2C coconuts%2C bananas%2C mangoes%2C papayas%2C pineapples%2C watermelons and even peanuts.
Tonga,https://wikitravel.org/en/Tonga,One thing to remember when going for a swim is that there are many sharp corals near the beach%2C especially near Tongatapu and PangaiMotu.

Trinidad and Tobago,https://wikitravel.org/en/Trinidad_and_Tobago,The Tobago Tourist Board boasts that "the wildlife in Tobago won't kill you"%2C which is mostly true.

Turkey,https://wikitravel.org/en/Turkey,There are many private estates dotting the whole coastline of Turkey%2C which the owner rents its property for campers. These campsites%2C which are called kamping in Turkish%2C have basic facilities such as tap water%2C toilets%2C tree shade (this is especially important in dry and hot summers of the western and southern coasts) and some provide electricity to every tent via individual wires. Pitching a tent inside the cities and towns apart from campsites is not always approved%2C so you should always ask the local administrator (village chief muhtar and/or gendarme jandarma in villages%2C municipalities belediye and/or the local police polis in towns) if there is a suitable place near the location for you to pitch your tent. Pitching a tent in the forest without permission is OK%2C unless the area is under protection as a national park%2C a bioreserve%2C a wildlife refuge%2C a natural heritage or because of some other environmental concern. Whether it is an area under protection or not%2C setting fire in forests apart from the designated fireplaces in recreational (read “picnic”) areas is forbidden anyway.
Turkey,https://wikitravel.org/en/Turkey,Water safety - However tempting it may be on a hot day%2C try to avoid water from public water tanks and fountains (şadırvan)%2C frequently found in the vicinity of mosques.

Turkey,https://wikitravel.org/en/Turkey,Public restrooms - Though many main squares and streets in the cities have a public restroom%2C if you cannot manage to find one%2C look for the nearest mosque%2C where you will see a public restroom in a corner of%2C or below its courtyard. Despite the fact that there is no shortage of cheap toilet papers anywhere in the country%2C however%2C you are unlikely to find toilet paper in almost any of the public restrooms (except lavatories of restaurants –including the road restaurants%2C hotels and most of the cafés and bars%2C of course). Instead%2C you are likely to find a bidét or a tap (Don't be puzzled. That's because devout Muslims use water instead of paper to clean up and paper usually used as a dryer after cleaning.). So it is a good idea to have a roll of toilet paper in your backpack during your walkings for sightseeing. It is best to take your single roll of toilet paper from home or bathroom of the hotel you’re staying at%2C because the smallest size available in Turkey market is 4-rolls per package (8-rolls per package being the commonest) which would last very long (actually longer than your trip%2C unless you will do all the road down to India overland). It isn’t expensive but it takes unnecessary backpack space%2C or unnecessary landfill space if you won’t use it liberally and won’t take the unused rolls back to home as an unusual souvenir from Turkey. In the better places on the road in the country there are rest rooms that are maintained and an attendent ready to collect YTL.50 to YTL 1. from the tourist for the privilege of using one. Restroom is tuvalet in colloquial Turkish%2C though you’ll more likely to see WC signs%2C complete with diagrams and doors signed Bay or Bayan (with their rather crude translations: ‘Men’%2C ‘Women’).
